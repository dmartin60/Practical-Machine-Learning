## Background  ##

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbitit is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self-movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, the goal is to use data from `accelerometers` on the `belt`, `forearm`, `arm`, and `dumbbell` of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the [website](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Data ##

The training data for this project are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv). 
The test data are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv). 

The data for this project come from this [source](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

## Assignment Objective ##

The assignment objective is to predict the manner in which exercises are performed as captured in the `classe` variable of the training set using any other variables to predict with. 

## Contents of this Repository##

This repository contains the samples of data downloaded, and the report.  The report details how the data is prepared, how the models were trained, and evaluated. The report illustrates how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error of the final model is.  Finally, the prediction model is used to predict 20 different test cases.
